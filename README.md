# FileExplorer in C++

This C++ application acts as a pseudo file explorer, allowing users to list local files, open files, and navigate through directories within the terminal or command line.

## About

The FileExplorer application is built using C++ and provides a simplified file listing and opening functionality similar to a file explorer. It utilizes system commands to interact with files and directories in the local system.

## Features

- List local files and directories.
- Open text files and view their contents within the terminal.
- Open multimedia files (e.g., .mp4) using system commands (example uses `xdg-open` for Linux).

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio).
3. Run the compiled executable to start the Pseudo FileExplorer app.
4. Use the menu options to list files, open files, and navigate directories.

## C++ Code

The C++ code in this application includes functions for listing files (`ListFiles`) and opening files (`OpenFile`). It uses system commands and file streams to interact with files and directories.
